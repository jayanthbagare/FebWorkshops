    "* Pattern matching is essential to understand historical trends in data to predict the future\n",
    "* Compute is expensive, we cannot run computers continuously, so knowing when to fire is essential. Fun Fact: A typical laptop uses 65-85w of electricity, guess how much our brain uses?\n",
    "* We specialize machine learning tasks, as models, each model spcializes as a single function\n",
    "* Ok, here we have no solution, the closest one we have is transfer learning"
