## Install Python and Conda from Anaconda

- [Go to Anaconda site](https://www.anaconda.com/products/distribution)
- Install based on your OS. 

### This will create a python installation with all the basic libraries needed for data science.

## Conda Environment

An environment is a shell for your project. 
Whatever libraries and dependencies you install in the environment, it is available only in that shell.

Python programs outside that shell will not be able to access the libraries.

## Jupyter Notebook

For developing in ML, you will extensively use Jupyter Notebook.
- Jupyter stands for **Ju**lia, **Py**thon and **R**.
- These are programming languages which this single development environment in your browser it supports.
- Jupyter notebooks ensure that both code and documentation are easily done.
- To run jupyter notebook, go to the folder you have your project and run `jupyter notebook`
- If the notebook does not open run `conda install -c anaconda jupyter`
